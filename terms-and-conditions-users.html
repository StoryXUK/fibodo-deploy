                                        unless otherwise stated.</p>
                                    <p>9.2 Prices for Provider Services may change at any time by posting new prices on
                                        the Site, but changes will not affect orders for which Booking Confirmations
                                        have already been sent. Where prices are incorrect and you decide not to
                                        proceed, the Provider shall offer either (i) a full refund within fourteen (14)
                                        days; or (ii) a voucher for the equivalent product or service to be redeemed
                                        later.</p>
                                    <p>9.3 By paying using your credit or debit card you confirm that the card is yours
                                        and that there are sufficient funds or credit available to cover the charges.
                                        The purchase will appear as a fibodo debit, with the booking reference code.</p>
                                    <p>9.4 We will place a temporary £1.00 authorisation hold on your card the first

                                        verification and your card will not be charged for this £1.00 verification.</p>
                                    <p>9.5 We may use third-party vendors (such as payment gateway providers). Our

                                    <p>10.2 Where you cancel after the Refund Window, we are under no obligation to
